# Comments on the Matlab language and IDE

## Language

- Loops have no parentheses so it gets quickly difficult to read

## IDE

- The auto-completion doesn't work really well
- Installing toolboxes is tedious, and takes too much time to do for every individual toolbox (plus it closes the IDE, so you can't work at the same time...)
- It's difficult to know in which toolbox a function is
