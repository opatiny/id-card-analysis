## `.mlx` files

They are files that can contain text and scripts at the same time. It is called the "Live editor" and it seems really powerful! In some way it is similar to a readme where the code bits are executed on the side.

### New `.mlx` file

Type the following command in the command line.

```m
edit newFile.mlx
```
